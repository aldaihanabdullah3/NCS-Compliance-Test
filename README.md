# NCS-Compliance-Test
Scripts used to check for compliance against National Cryptographic Standards (NCS) of National Cyber Agency in Saudi Arabia. Right now, the script checks TLS compliance only.

# Contributions
Please let me know if you would like to contribute to this project, the NCS includes standards for many protocols and applications (DNS, Emails, Certificates and much more!). my plan is to make this a ubiquitous tool that is capable of doing a comprhensive test to check for NCS compliance.
